## Fresh Air
It is too nice of a day not to get outside today. I'll plan to take a 30 minute run at some point to get my body moving and get out of doors. Not much more to be said,
I have been craving some time out in the woods, on some trails or on some water lately. I've been spending a lot of time working at the computer and doing some finishing work
on the basement. Time to step away from both of those for a while.
